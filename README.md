# LittleTerminal-Project
This project is about creating a LittleTerminal from zero. And no priore knowledge of how Terminal and file systems works. A long the joureny, I'll pick up a new information along the way. 

# Some ideas to apply: *Last updated: 11/02/2024*
-  The version is V0.0.1B
-  Basic commands for processing text files:
  -  ``` readtexty``` for displaying the content of the text files below the prompt.
  -  ``` writetexty``` for overwriting the content of the text file.
  -  ``` lt-version``` for displaying the current version of the **LittleTerminal**.
- Navigation system to jump from directory to another.


# LittleTerminal updates log:
